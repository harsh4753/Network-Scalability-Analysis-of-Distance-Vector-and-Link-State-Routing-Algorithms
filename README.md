 Comparative-Analysis-of-Link-State-and-Distance-Vector-Routing-Algorithms-using-ns2

This repository presents the results of a comprehensive performance analysis of two routing protocols, DVRP  and LSRP , conducted using NS2 simulation. The study evaluates these protocols in terms of critical parameters such as throughput, packet loss, average delay, and scalability as the network size increases.
this is Computer Networks course project in ns2 simulator



To run :

Install ns2 simulator and install nam to visualize the ns simulations and real world packet trace data
and then type in terminal
>ns dvProg.tcl

  OR

>ns lsProg.tcl
