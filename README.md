# Network-Scalability-Analysis-of-Distance-Vector-and-Link-State-Routing-Algorithms
This repository presents the results of a comprehensive performance analysis of two routing protocols, DVRP  and LSRP , conducted using NS2 simulation. The study evaluates these protocols in terms of critical parameters such as throughput, packet loss, average delay, and scalability as the network size increases.
